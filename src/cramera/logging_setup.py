    A named logger that propagates to the root logger's handlers.

    Some libraries (for example ROS 2's ``launch`` package) call
    :func:`logging.setLoggerClass` at import time with a class whose
    constructor forces ``propagate = False``. Since :func:`logging.getLogger`
    reuses that class for every logger created afterwards, an unrelated import
    elsewhere in the process can silently stop ``cramera``'s own log records
    from ever reaching a handler. Setting ``propagate`` explicitly overrides
    whatever the ambient logger class did — on the package's root logger as
    well, since a record travelling up from a module logger is dropped there
    too.
