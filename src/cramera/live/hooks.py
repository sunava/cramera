"""
Hooks that attach the bridge to a running coraplex/giskardpy demo.

Each hook installs a :class:`LiveHooks` method in place of one CRAM method; that
method forwards what it observes to the bridge, and all of the interpretation lives
there. Installing is idempotent, so the two documented ways of starting live mode can
be combined safely.

.. warning:: Every world access (forward kinematics for poses etc.) happens on
   the *simulation* thread itself, inside the ``Executor.tick`` hook. Reading
   the world from a separate sampler thread corrupts the native solver's heap
   — the HTTP handlers therefore only ever serve the last finished snapshot
   dict.
